# Gyaan-Shaala ðŸ“‘
- Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for Gyaan-Shaala, a fully functional ed-tech platform.This server-side application is built using the MERN stack (NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB). It powers all the core functionalities of the platform, from user authentication to course management and payment processing.

The backend follows a monolithic architecture and exposes a comprehensive RESTful API for the ReactJS front-end client to consume.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

The backend provides a range of robust features, including:

* User Authentication & Authorization: Secure user signup and login for both students and instructors using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Includes OTP verification and password reset functionality.
* Course Management: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for instructors to manage courses and their content.
* Payment Integration: Seamless payment processing for course purchases handled through Razorpay integration.
* Cloud Media Management: All media content (videos, images, PDFs) is efficiently stored and managed using the Cloudinary cloud service.
* Rating and Reviews: Allows students to view and rate the courses they are enrolled in
* Secure Password Handling: User passwords are encrypted using bcrypt for an added layer of security

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Dependencies

The backend is built with a modern and scalable tech stack:

* Runtime Environment: Node.js 
* Framework: Express.js
* Database: MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas) with Mongoose as the ODM 
* Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* Password Hashing: Bcrypt
* Media Storage: Cloudinary 
*Payment Gateway: Razorpay 

## ðŸ—„ Database Schema

The database is built using MongoDB and uses Mongoose schemas to model the application data The core data models include:
* Student Schema 
* Instructor Schema 
* Course Schema 
* Other schemas for profiles, course progress, ratings, tags, and more
